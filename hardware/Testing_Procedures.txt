1) Unpack all equipment and connect up power cables as follows:

- CANADIAN MAINS: Sepia II Unit
				: SNOdrop PC
				: Laser Switch
- TRANSFORMER + ENGLISH MULTI-ADAPTER: Fibre Switch
									 : PMT Power Supply
								     : Power Meter

2) Lasers should be set up on the breadboard using the Allen screws and key from Oxford (see "Setup_Breadboard.jpg")

-------------------------


3) LASER Testing
- remember to change the power meter wavelength for each laser, and ZERO the meter between measurements

- BARE readings: photodiode is placed directly in front of laser-head (see "Testing_BarePowerReading.jpg")
- Sepia settings: 20Mhz internal triggering, 100% laser intensity

- The results below are from testing in the SNOLab Surface Electronics Lab
- Note: these were done with the lights ON, but the zero should mostly take care of this offset

-- 375nm: 0.495mW (Oxford: 0.494mW, Manual: 0.49mW)
-- 405nm: 1.99mW (Oxford: 1.99mW, Manual: 1.9mW)
-- 440nm: 1.93mW (Oxford: 1.92mW, Manual: 1.8mW)
-- 500nm: 1.068mW (Oxford: 1.091mW, Manual: 1.1mW)

- COUPLING readings: photodiode connected to end of 1m fibre, which is coupled to the laser-head
- same Sepia settings as above

-- 375nm: 0.433mW (87.5% of the bare reading above)
-- 405nm: 1.799mW (90.5%)
-- 440nm: 1.705mW (88.6%)
-- 500nm: 0.999mW (93.5%)

-------------------------


4) LASER and FIBRE SWITCH TESTING
- power connections: 2x Canadian mains from back of Laser Switch
		   : 1x cable between Sepia and Laser Switch (3-pin male-to-female)

- connect all 4 lasers via LEMO cables into the Laser Switch channels 1 to 4
- connect all 4 lasers by optical fibre into the Fibre Switch inputs 1 to 4
- uncap all 14 Fibre Switch outputs and make sure Fibre Switch is BELOW EYE-LEVEL

- the test script will run over all 4(5) inputs, and for each one run over all 14 outputs
- check by eye to see if laser light is emitted from each output
- the "laser switch" argument in the test script must match the Laser Switch channels being used

- since we only have 4 lasers, we still need to check input 5 on the Fibre Switch and channels 0 and 5 on the Laser Switch
- repeat the test script, but with modified arguments for these combinations (see test script for details)

-- all 6 Laser Switch channels work, and there were no problems when switching between them
-- all input/outputs channel combinations on the Fibre Switch work (qualitatively)

-------------------------


5) PMT BOX TESTING
- this is to check that there has been no damage to the PMT boxes during shipping

- connect the input trigger (either from NI or ORCA), and output the TrigOut signal to a scope ... should (and did) see -1 to 2V square(ish) wave
- connect a single laser (only 1 is required for this test) to the PMT-fibre coupling, and output the PMTOut signal to scope ... should see standard PMT pulse
- connect the SampledOut signal to scope ... should see a rising signal following the PMT pulse, and then hold at the peak PMT value

- CALIBRATE the PMT boxes (using the steps outlined in the separate document)
-- PMT box SN191924 was calibrated with no problems
-- PMT box SN191925 has a very slight (~20mV) initial peak on the sampled output, even after calibration (for reference, SN191924 had a peak indistinguishable from noise, <10mV)


-------------------------


6) BEAMSPLITTER TESTING
- we want to characterise: the splitter's split ratio (i.e. check that it is as advertised)
			 : the variability per pulse of the split ratio (hopefully this does not change much or at all)

FOR EACH LASER:

	- connect a single laser into PMT Box 1 via a 1m patch fibre, and the PMT-Out socket of the PMT Box into a scope with a 50ohm load
	- adjust the gain on the PMT Box until the peak value is 2V
	- repeat the above 2 steps for PMT Box 2
	-- NOTE that the gains will be different for the 2 PMT boxes, because one of them has a MTP connection, which results in overall more lost light between laser and PMT


	FOR EACH BEAMSPLITTER:

		- connect the splitter's Input 1 to the laser, Output A to PMT Box 1, and Output B to PMT Box 2

		FOR VARYING LASER INTENSITY:

			- fire 10,000 laser pulses through the splitter, and record the resulting sampled output voltage PER PULSE from each PMT Box (see software script)

		- switch the beamsplitter outputs ... i.e. now connect Output B to PMT Box 1, and Output A to PMT Box 2
		- repeat the varying laser intensity measurement using the software script

		-- Note that because the lasers have different operational ranges (in terms of intensity), the actual range of varying intensities will be different for each laser
